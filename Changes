Revision history for Perl module HTML::GenToc.
==============================================

1.4  Wed 20th November 2002
	- CPAN testers complained about a lack of explicitly stating
all the dependencies of AppConfig, which either means that AppConfig
has changed desperately, or their testing methods have changed, since
I didn't think it was possible to get the AppConfig module without getting
all its dependent modules, but, oh well.

1.3  Sun 17th November 2002
	- fixed minor bug where the filename was always included in
the table of contents even when it was an inline TOC and the filename
in question was the containing file. (Only a minor bug because the link
still worked, but it messed up things when the file in question was
a .shtml file which had query arguments to it; presumably would mess up
things like .php files as well.)

1.2  Sat 26th October 2002
	- fixed bug which would produce rubbish in the TOC if
there happened to be an element which had an *attribute* which
had content which matched a TOC entry; this would make it start
collecting content for that, and never find an end-tag for it.

1.1  Wed 28th August 2002
	- fixed bug with requirements which prevented working with perl 5.5

1.0  Fri 24th May 2002
	- cleaned up the tests (now uses Test::Simple and compares test files
nicely)
	- rearranged the documentation
	- added --help and --manpage options

0.3  Fri 1st Mar 2002
	- added --notoc_match option to suppress ToC for individual tags

0.2  Sat 23rd Feb 2002
	- added README file
	- updated documentation
	- made the generated ToC more XHTML compliant
	- changed tests slightly

0.1  Mon 28th Jan 2002
	- conversion of htmltoc to a module
	- use HTML::SimpleParse to parse the HTML
	- split the ToC generation into two phases; generate_anchors
and generate_toc
	- expanded the --inline option to place the ToC after the first
instance of any tag, or to replace a given tag
	- no longer use prefix + $$ to make anchor names unique; instead
derive them from the content of the significant element.
	- various other slight improvements
